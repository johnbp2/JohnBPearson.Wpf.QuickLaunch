## Introducing the tool bar butler ##

This is part of "my butler" tools. My butler apps are a collection of tools for productivity. Like Mr.Belvedere they are there to do your menial tasks. 
You know how the took toolbars away in win 11? That bug you too? Well this gives it back to you, kind of*. It makes an animated tool bar based on a folder of your choice, just put you links, exes, or shortcuts in a folder and point this bad boy to it. 

*This butler tool attempts to provide a crude quick launch/tool bar implementation.    Its really kind of crappy but it helps me learn WPF. Adding and fixing features all the time. Want something added, Want to berate me, Want to discuss the anxiety i get from cats, or anything thing else     post an issue or comment.
