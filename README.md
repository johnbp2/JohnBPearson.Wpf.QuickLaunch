## Introducing the tool bar butler ##

This is part of "my butler" tools. My butler apps are a collection of tools for productivity. Like Mr.Belvedere they are there to do your menial tasks. 
I didn't like that they took away the toolbars in windows 11. Here is my half-assed attempt at making an ugly marginal wpf toolbar. 
#Usage#
- Put links, shortcuts, bat files in a folder
- run this app.
- click settings
- then the browse button to select your folder.
- it usually works

Know issues. 
- It blows up when you try to click on icons representing custom windows commands (show desktop.lnk, switch between windows.lnk, links to control panel items, etc).
