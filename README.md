## Introducing the tool bar butler ##

This is part of "my butler" tools. My butler apps are a collection of tools for productivity. Like Mr.Belvedere they are there to do your menial tasks. 

Some of the tools try to give an alternative to windows features that were removed in version 11. This butler tool attempts to provide a crude quick launch/tool bar implementation.    
It will generate a toolbar using the folder of your choice. Also check out my hotkey butler app. Perfect for pasting repetitive commands to the terminal or pasting complex passwords.
